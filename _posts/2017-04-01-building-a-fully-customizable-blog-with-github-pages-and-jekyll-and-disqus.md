A personal blog is one of the easiest and affordable medium of sharing your thoughts with others. As a developer, you need a way to
- Showcase you capabilities
- Document your learning and experiments so you can return to them in the future
- Share your thoughts with others as well as providing a guide to other developers who may be currently struggling with a problem you have encountered and solved in the past.

While there are several options available for setting up a personal blog, working with Github pages affords you the convenience of working from your Github profile while sharing your projects with other. Github pages is also a great too for project documentation.Another interesting feature of blogging with Jekyll is that you can write you blogpost with [markdown](http://commonmark.org/help/) 

In this post I am going to share with you how this blog was set up straight from my [github page](https://github.com/EzechukwuJI/ezechukwuji.github.io) and customized using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I will also share how to add automated commenting to your blog using [disqus](https://disqus.com/). That said, enough introduction already. Let's get started.
