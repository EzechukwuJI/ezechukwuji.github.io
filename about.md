I am James Ezechukwu, a backend developer from Nigeria. I love building awesome things with Python using the Django framework, with a penchant for usability, scalabilit, maintenability  and performance,

### Story and experience
I am a Civil Engineer turned programmer and this switch has remained the best decision I've made in my adult life after falling in love with egusi soup( I'm sure you'll love it).

I'm predominantly a Python developer and have written some awesome scripts that power sites like [smatpost,](http://smatpost.com/) [sokohali,](http://www.sokohali.com/) [EasyPR Nigeria](http://www.easypr.ng/) - Africa's foremost press distribution and syndication platform. 
I also tinker around some interesting cross-platform mobile development with C# and Xamarin, working towards mastery.

I currently live in Lagos where I work as a part time Python/Django trainer at [Switch](http://switch.ng) while providing technical support for [EasyPR](http://www.easypr.ng/).

I also write stuff on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ezechukwuji) and throw some code on [GitHub](https://github.com/EzechukwuJI).
