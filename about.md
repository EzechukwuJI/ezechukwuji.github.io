I am James Ezechukwu, a backend developer from Nigeria. I love building awesome things with Python using the Django framework, with a penchant for usability, scalability, maintainability  and performance,

### Story and experience
I am a Civil Engineer turned programmer and this switch has remained the best decision I've made in my adult life after falling in love with [**Egusi soup**](https://www.google.com.ng/search?q=egusi+soup&oq=egusi&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0l4.2169j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) - I'm sure you'll love it.

I'm predominantly a Python developer and have written some awesome scripts that power sites like [**Smatpost**,](http://smatpost.com/) [**Sokohali**,](http://www.sokohali.com/) [**EasyPR Nigeria**](http://easypr.pythonanywhere.com/) - Africa's foremost press distribution and syndication platform. 
I also tinker around some interesting cross-platform mobile development with C# and Xamarin, working towards mastery.

I currently live in Lagos where I work as a part time Python/Django trainer at [**Univelcity**](http://univelcity.com/) while providing technical support for [**EasyPR**](http://easypr.pythonanywhere.com/).

I also write stuff on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ezechukwuji) and throw some code on [GitHub](https://github.com/EzechukwuJI).
